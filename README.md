# Python Programming Course - Community College

# Course Overview

Welcome to the Python Programming Course at [Calhoun Community College]! This course is designed to introduce you to the fundamentals of Python programming, providing you with the skills needed to develop basic applications and understand key programming concepts.

# Course Objectives

By the end of this course, you will be able to:

Understand and use Python syntax and semantics.
Write and debug Python code effectively.
Work with data structures such as lists, dictionaries, and tuples.
Implement control structures such as loops and conditional statements.
Develop functions to improve code modularity and reuse.
Read and write files in Python.
Utilize libraries and modules to extend Python functionality.
Apply problem-solving skills to real-world programming tasks.
Course Structure
The course is divided into weekly modules, each focusing on specific topics and skills. Each module includes lectures, readings, hands-on exercises, and assignments.

# Chapters

Chapter 2:

We designed projects focused on enhancing our understanding of input and output. By tackling problems that required user input to start the program, we then performed a series of mathematical calculations to generate a response. Through this, I learned how to prompt the user effectively and what to anticipate from the computer once the process was completed.

Chapter 3:

We concentrated on learning decision structures and concepts like if-else statements. We created projects that prompted users for input, compared their responses to a set of predefined answers, and then returned the appropriate response. Through this, I learned how websites and applications use decision structures to return values to users, such as executing one action when a button is clicked and a different action if it isn't..

Chapter 4:

We implemented repetition structures such as for loops and while loops, enabling the program to run continuously without requiring the user to restart it manually. The program continued until it met a predefined set of conditions, which then terminated it. This part of the course gave me a better understanding of how video games use repetition structures to run indefinitely until the user ends the game or achieves a specific score.

Chapter 5:

In this chapter, we focused on creating functions to build blocks of code, which helped us gain a deeper understanding of how call stacks work. I learned how Python uses the main keyword function to call other functions, returning results to users during these calls.
