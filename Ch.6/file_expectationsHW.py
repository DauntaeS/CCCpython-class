# Write a program that asks the user for his or her name, then asks the user to enter a sentence that describes himself or herself. Here is an example of the programâ€™s screen: Submit a screenshot of output that should include a screenshot of the folder where your html file is created and a screenshot of the file opened in the browser.

# Enter your name: John Doe [Enter]
# Describe yourself: I am a computer science major
# Once the user has entered the requested input, the program should create an HTML file, containing the input, for a simple Web page. Here is an example of the HTML content, using the sample input previously shown:

# <html>
# <body>
# <h1>John Doe</h1>
# <hr />
# I am a computer science major
# <hr />
# </body>
# </html>
# This is how your html file should look when opened in a browser.
